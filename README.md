# TypeScript Action Template

Our custom template repository for GitHub Actions implemented in TypeScript.

[Creating a repository from a template][docs].

[docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template

**NOTE**: Be sure to look for strings like "TODO" or "Action name" and update
them accordingly.

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: freckle/TODO-action@v1
```

## Inputs and Outputs

See [action.yml](./action.yml) for a complete list of inputs and outputs.

## Permissions

This action requires the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions: {}
```

As the action uses the GitHub API, these should be updated to reflect the
minimal permissions required. These permissions may need to be manually set in
certain scenarios, such as workflows triggered by Dependabot PRs, which use a
read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Versioning

Versioned tags will exist, such as `v1.0.0` and `v2.1.1`. Branches will exist
for each major version, such as `v1` or `v2` and contain the newest version in
that series.

### Release Process

Given a latest version of v1.0.1,

Is this a new major version?

If yes,

```console
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b v2
git tag -s -m v2.0.0 v2.0.0
git push --follow-tags
```

Otherwise,

```console
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout v1
git merge --ff-only -
git tag -s -m v1.0.2 v1.0.2    # or v1.1.0
git push --follow-tags
```
